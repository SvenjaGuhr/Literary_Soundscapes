# Literary_Soundscapes
Code and data for the analysis of literary soundscapes in the DNov (Dickens Novel Corpus)

Three Notebooks:
1) Preparation of the TXT files as XML for automated sound annotation with NEISS NTEE
2) Loudness level labeling with a dictionary matching algorithm and enrichment of the XML files
3) Sound analysis and different visualizations of the annotations per chapter or scene if applicable
