    "Given an automatically annotated corpus of sound events, the annotations are cleaned from frequent false positives by string matching. \n",

    "The csv is then opened as a pandas dataframe, in which a copy of the sound event spans is lemmatized and lowercased in preparation for the matching algorithm, which detects sound words that have a loudness level assigned to them in the loudness level dictionary. \n",
